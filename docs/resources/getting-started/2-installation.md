You can download the latest rbxm from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alicesaidhi/conch/releases/latest/) or by pressing the button below. All packages expect to be within the same folder.
You can drag the rbxm into Studio. You should place your packages somewhere where both the client and server can access it, ideally ReplicatedStorage.
